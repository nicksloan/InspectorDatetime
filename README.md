InspectorDatetime
=================

This is a shim for date and time inputs. The name is a reference to Inspector Spacetime, a Doctor Who parody on the show Community.

Also, this isn't really about date and time inputs anymore. Those shims will be included, but this is becoming a generic masked input polyfill. The name will likely change to reflect that later on.
